## Miyou is an online anime streaming site built using React.js

### `npm i` (Install the dependencies)

### `npm start` (Run locally)

### Set up your .env file

First add a .env file in your root directory. Then add
`REACT_APP_BACKEND_URL='https://miyou-api.up.railway.app/'`
`REACT_APP_BASE_URL='https://graphql.anilist.co'`

## Disclaimer :

I'm privating the backend repo because a lot of people are copying the project without giving any credits and pretending to be the real one. You can only test this on your localhost and cannot host it. It will give you CORS error.
